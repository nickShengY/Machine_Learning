### Practice Machine Learning Algorithms

In this Directory, I will put the codes that I try to implement the major basic machine learning algorithms, either using popular packages or from scratch with only Numpy and Pandas.   

**In this directory, I will implement:**  
* Bullet list  
    * Linear Regression  
    * Logistic Regression  
    * Ridge Regression  
    * Elastic-Net Regression  
    * KNN  
    * Gaussian Bayes  
    * Regression Tree  
    * Xgboost  
    * Catboost  
    * Light GBM    

  ...





#### Acknowleage: All the implementations are for study purposes. Shout out to @StatQuest on YouTube for most of the ideas and clarification.
